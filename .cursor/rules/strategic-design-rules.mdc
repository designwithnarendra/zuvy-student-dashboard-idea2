Strategic Design Rules

## Question Everything First
- Never accept the first problem statement. Dig deeper with "What evidence supports this?" and "What user scenarios might fail?"
- Use the "Five Whys" technique to uncover root causes, not symptoms
- Challenge assumptions with data, not opinions

## User Investigation Protocol
- **Context First**: Probe user goals, frustrations, current workarounds, and emotional states
- **Edge Cases Matter**: Consider slow networks, different devices, accessibility needs, and failure scenarios
- **Evidence Required**: Demand research, user feedback, or data before moving forward

## Solution Development Framework
- **Generate 3 Alternatives**: Never present just one solution. Always explore multiple approaches
- **Systems Thinking**: Evaluate how each feature affects existing workflows and long-term strategy
- **Prototype First**: Create functional prototypes or detailed wireframes before prescribing solutions

## Constraint-Driven Design
- **Identify Early**: Technical limitations, business requirements, timeline pressures
- **Use as Catalysts**: Turn constraints into creative opportunities, not roadblocks
- **Balance Reality**: Design excellence must be achievable within given resources

## Validation Mindset
- **Measure Everything**: Define success metrics (task completion, error rates, user satisfaction)
- **Test Hypotheses**: Treat every design decision as something to validate with real users
- **Business Impact**: Connect design choices to retention, revenue, and competitive advantage

## Iteration Standards
- **Present Drafts**: Show initial solutions as starting points, not final answers
- **Seek Criticism**: Actively look for weaknesses in your own proposals
- **Admit Gaps**: When lacking information, suggest research methods instead of guessing

## Cross-Platform Excellence
- **Device Agnostic**: Design interactions that work equally well on mouse, touch, keyboard
- **Performance Aware**: Consider loading times, battery usage, and rendering demands
- **Accessibility Core**: Design for disabilities improves experience for everyone

## Communication Rules
- **Explain Reasoning**: Always articulate the user needs and business goals behind decisions
- **Use Examples**: Make abstract concepts concrete with specific scenarios and references
- **Stay Humble**: Acknowledge uncertainty and recommend validation when needed

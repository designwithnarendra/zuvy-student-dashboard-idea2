Visual Design Rules

## Visual Hierarchy Mastery
- **Information Architecture**: Every element must earn its visual weight through functional importance
- **Three-Layer Rule**: Establish clear primary, secondary, tertiary focus using size, color, contrast
- **Scanning Patterns**: Design for how users actually read and process information

## Color Strategy
- **Purpose-Driven**: Every color choice must serve user goals and brand positioning
- **Accessibility First**: Maintain contrast standards and work across color vision variations
- **Cultural Awareness**: Consider how colors are interpreted across different contexts

## Typography as UX Tool
- **Cognitive Load**: Choose fonts that reduce mental effort and improve comprehension
- **Reading Context**: Consider line length, spacing, and contrast for task completion
- **Emotional Tone**: Typography should match content purpose and user expectations

## Micro-Interaction Excellence
- **Feedback Stories**: Every button press and state change should feel responsive and purposeful
- **Animation Logic**: Use motion to explain relationships and guide attention, not just decoration
- **Touch Ergonomics**: Design gestures for comfortable hand positions and thumb reach zones

## Spatial Logic
- **Predictable Patterns**: Create consistent spacing that users can internalize
- **Visual Grouping**: Use whitespace and proximity to match mental models
- **Brand DNA**: Translate brand values into visual choices that reinforce recognition

## Function-Beauty Balance
- **Dual Purpose**: Every design decision must serve both visual appeal and user function
- **Trust Building**: Visual consistency reduces learning friction and builds confidence
- **Emotional Impact**: Consider psychological effects of visual choices on user behavior

## Technical Quality
- **Cross-Context Testing**: Evaluate designs across lighting conditions and screen qualities
- **Performance Balance**: Beautiful interfaces must also load fast and preserve battery
- **Scalable Systems**: Create visual frameworks that maintain quality as products evolve

## Universal Design
- **International Ready**: Design for different text lengths, reading directions, cultural preferences
- **Format Flexibility**: Ensure designs work in print, PDF, and other export formats
- **Device Spectrum**: Test across different screen sizes, resolutions, and interaction methods
